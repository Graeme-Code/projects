Gnosis builds new market mechanisms for open finance.

Global interconnection has proved that open access to information, resources, and financial infrastructure is key for global resilience. By designing fairer marketplaces, Gnosis aims to build a more evenly distributed future. Our three interoperable product lines allow you to securely create, trade, and hold crypto assets.

**Create:** Gnosis developed an open framework for creating crypto assets that represent information about future events with conditional outcomes. These conditional tokens can be integrated with prediction markets and other applications.

**Trade:** Gnosis Protocol is a fully permissionless DEX, which has been in research and development over the course of the last two years. Gnosis Protocol enables ring trades to maximize liquidity.

**Hold:** The Gnosis Safe Multisig is the most trusted platform to store digital assets on Ethereum and the only formally verified smart contract wallet.
